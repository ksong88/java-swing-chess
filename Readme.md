This is a Chess game with movement of pieces and turns implemented.

When a square with a piece is clicked, it will be highlighted to indicate that the piece is selected.

If the destination square is empty, the selected piece will be moved to the destination square.

If the destination square has a piece on the opposing team, that piece will be replaced by the currently selected piece.

If the destination square is on the same team, nothing will happen and you will need to choose a valid square (empty / opposing team)
or the same square to cancel piece selection.
